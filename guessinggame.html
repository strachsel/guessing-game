    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <h5>-<i>My success isn't a result of arrogance - it's a result of belief</i>.</h5>

    <p>I was born in Naples in 1991. My parents moved to Virginia about 2 weeks later where we lived for about 6 months. We then lived in Seattle for another year before moving to Portland.</p>

    <p>I gruduated from Central Catholic High School in 2009 where I played basketball, soccer, and golf and wrote some fluff pieces for the school paper.</p>

    <p>I attended the University of San Diego where I studied international relations and business.</p>

    <p>After graudating in 2013 I had a couple job working for a non-profit assisting Irish students on temporary work visas in San Diego and for a outside sales company which I frankly would not recommend to anyone. That led me to where I am now working in the purchasing department at Craig Stein Beverage.</p>

    <h4>Work</h4>
      <p>I am currently a assitant buyer for a small beverage distribution company called CSB in Vancouver, WA.</p>
      <p>The company primairily works in beer distribution; I handle the non-alcoholic and spirit accounts along with a lot of the supportive functions of my department.</p>

    <h4>Misc</h4>
      <p>I have lived in Portland for most of my life. I have a lot of extended family on the east coast so I have been over that way quite often.</p>
      <p>I love basbetball so if anyone ever wants to shoot some hoops or hit up a blazer's game, you know who to call.</p>
